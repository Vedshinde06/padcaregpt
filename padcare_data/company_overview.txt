PadCare (PadCare Labs Pvt. Ltd.) is an Indian clean-tech and sanitation startup focused on providing safe, scientific, and sustainable solutions for sanitary waste management, particularly menstrual hygiene waste such as used sanitary pads.

PadCare operates at the intersection of climate action, women’s health, sanitation infrastructure, and circular economy. The company builds decentralized, technology-driven systems that collect, sanitize, and recycle sanitary waste, converting it into reusable raw materials while ensuring hygiene, environmental protection, and dignity for sanitation workers.

PadCare offers its solution through a service-based model known as Menstrual Hygiene Management as a Service (MHMaaS), which covers the complete lifecycle of sanitary waste—from disposal at the source to recycling and reuse.

The company’s mission is to make modern sanitation choices safer and recyclable for women across the world, while promoting inclusiveness, equality, and sustainable public hygiene practices.
