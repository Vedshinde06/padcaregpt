SOURCE: PadCare About section, founder narrative

PadCare was founded by Ajinkya Dhariya, a mechanical engineering student who was inspired to act after witnessing used sanitary napkins discarded in a natural forest area near Pune.

Further exposure to landfill conditions revealed the manual handling of sanitary waste by waste pickers, highlighting severe health risks and social stigma. This experience motivated the creation of a solution that addressed sanitary waste disposal with dignity, safety, and sustainability.

After multiple prototype iterations, PadCare was formally established to build a scalable system that could manage menstrual waste responsibly while protecting both people and the environment.
