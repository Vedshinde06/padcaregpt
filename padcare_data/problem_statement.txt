Sanitary waste management is a significant but often neglected problem in India and many developing countries. Millions of women use sanitary pads that are largely non-biodegradable and contain plastic and super-absorbent polymers.

Key challenges include:

Used sanitary pads can take 500–800 years to decompose.

Most pads end up in landfills, water bodies, or are openly burned.

Improper incineration releases toxic emissions.

Manual handling of sanitary waste exposes sanitation workers to serious health risks and social stigma.

Lack of organized, hygienic, and scalable systems for menstrual waste disposal.

This issue exists at the intersection of:

Menstrual hygiene

Waste management

Environmental sustainability

Worker safety and dignity

PadCare was created to address these challenges through a safe, scalable, and circular waste-management system.
